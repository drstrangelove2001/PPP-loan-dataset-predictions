In the spring of 2020, the US government announced a loan program, called Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), to help stabilize the American economy in the face of job losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this project, we used PPP loan dataset, which contains information about millions of loans to small businesses during the pandemic. To be specific, we built a binary classification ML model, using the available borrower, lender and loan information to predict LoanStatus:
•	Positive (1): Paid in Full
•	Negative (0): Charged Off or Exemption 4

In the future, when such loan program required, we can use this model to predict whether the borrower will pay back the loan in full or not.
